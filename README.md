# Multithreaded-Producer-Consumer-Application
multithreaded Producer-Consumer application that utilizes a circular bounded buffer to manage data exchange between threads. The primary goal is to implement synchronization mechanisms using semaphores and mutexes to ensure data integrity and prevent race conditions.
Includes:
- Compilation command using gcc and pthreads
- Example run with input parameters
- Explanation of expected output
- Notes on poison pill termination and synchronization behavior
